                <p class="docx_heading1">Introduction</p>
                <p>As discussed in Chapter 4, <span style="font-weight: bold">reliability</span> and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">consistent performance</span> are critical considerations in the
                    design of new products. Whether a product is <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">repairable</span> (e.g., a stove) or <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">non-repairable</span> (e.g., a light bulb), its <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">total life cycle cost</span> and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">acquisition cost</span> are significantly influenced by how long it
                    operates without failure—in other words, by its <span style="font-weight: bold">reliability</span>.
                </p>
                <p>Even in service-oriented businesses, operational success depends heavily on the performance of
                    machinery, equipment, and other physical assets. The uninterrupted functioning of these assets is
                    essential, and this can only be ensured through effective <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">maintenance practices</span>.</p>
                <p>Reliability and maintenance are, therefore, foundational elements of <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">operations management</span>, directly impacting a firm’s efficiency,
                    service quality, and return on investment. This chapter delves into these concepts in detail,
                    supported by numerical examples and practical applications to illustrate their relevance in
                    real-world operational contexts.</p>
                <p class="docx_heading1">Concept and Definition of Reliability </p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reliability</span> refers to the probability that a machine, product,
                    or system will perform its intended function without failure over a specified period under stated
                    operating conditions. The emphasis on “specified time” is crucial—it reflects the idea of <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">quality sustained over time</span>. In practical terms, when we
                    design, produce, or use products, we expect them to maintain a consistent level of performance
                    throughout their expected lifespan.</p>
                <p>Reliability is not limited to individual components; it extends to entire systems. A <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">system</span> typically comprises multiple <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">subsystems</span>, each made up of individual components. The overall
                    reliability of a system depends on the reliability of its constituent parts. In many cases,
                    especially when components are arranged in series, the system’s reliability is the <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">product of the reliabilities of its components</span>. This
                    interdependence highlights the importance of designing and maintaining each part to ensure the
                    system functions as intended.</p>
                <p>Reliability is a key performance metric in both manufacturing and service operations, influencing
                    product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.</p>
                <p class="docx_heading2">System Reliability</p>
                <p>In operations management and engineering design, <span style="font-weight: bold">system
                        reliability</span> refers to the likelihood that an entire system will function without failure
                    over a specified period. For a system composed of n components arranged in <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">series</span>, the system reliability is calculated as the product of
                    the reliabilities of each individual component:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">R</span><span
                        style="font-weight: bold"><sub>s</sub></span><span style="font-weight: bold"> = R</span><span
                        style="font-weight: bold"><sub>1</sub></span><span style="font-weight: bold"> x R</span><span
                        style="font-weight: bold"><sub>2</sub></span><span style="font-weight: bold"> x… x R</span><span
                        style="font-weight: bold"><sub>n</sub></span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Example:</span><br />Consider a system with four components arranged
                    in series, where:</p>
                <p>
                <div><img
                        alt="A black line with two rectangular objects&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."
                        src="blob:http://192.168.0.104:8081/773881cc-8deb-48e2-803b-2bf983819c5e" id="docx-image-rId6"
                        data-part-id="rId6" /></div>
                </p>
                <p>The system reliability is:</p>
                <p>Rs = 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.1728</p>
                <p>This means the system has a <span style="font-weight: bold">17.28%</span> chance of functioning
                    without failure over the specified time period.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that although each individual component has a relatively high reliability,
                    the overall system reliability is significantly lower. This is because in a <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">series configuration</span>, the system fails if <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">any one component fails</span>. As more components are added in
                    series, the probability of system failure increases, resulting in a decline in overall reliability.
                </p>
                <p>Figure illustrates how system reliability decreases as the number of components in series increases.

                <p>To counteract this decline, designers often introduce <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">redundancy</span>—additional components or backup systems that can
                    take over in case of failure. Redundancy can significantly improve system reliability, especially in
                    critical applications.</p>
                <p class="docx_heading2">Redundancy in System Reliability</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Redundancy</span> refers to the inclusion of additional or backup
                    components in a system to enhance its overall reliability. In a redundant system, components are
                    arranged in <span style="font-weight: bold">parallel</span>, meaning the system continues to
                    function as long as <span style="font-weight: bold">at least one</span> of the parallel components
                    is operational. The system only fails when <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> redundant
                    components fail.</p>
                <p>Redundancy can involve one or more backup units. For example, an n-unit parallel system includes
                    multiple components operating in parallel, any of which can sustain the system’s functionality.</p>

                    </span></p>
                <p>Without redundancy, the system reliability was:</p>
                <p>Rs ​= 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.1728 or 17.28%</p>
                <p>Now, suppose <span style="font-weight: bold">R₂</span> and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">R₃</span> are each backed up by identical components (i.e., parallel
                    redundancy). The new system reliability becomes:</p>
                <p>Rs ​= R1 ​× [R2 ​+ R2 ​(1−R2​)] × [R3 ​+ R3 ​(1−R3​)] × R4​</p>

                    0.2903 or 29.03%</p>
                <p>This demonstrates a significant improvement in system reliability—from <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">17.28% to 29.03%</span>—achieved by introducing redundancy in just two

                    component can trigger <span style="font-weight: bold">cascading failures</span> in others,
                    increasing the system’s vulnerability. This phenomenon is particularly evident in complex systems
                    such as <span style="font-weight: bold">weather models</span>, <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">financial markets</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">power
                        grids</span>, where changes follow <span style="font-weight: bold">stochastic
                        patterns</span> and are often modelled using advanced tools like <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">Markov Chains</span>. While such modelling is beyond the scope of this
                    textbook, the concept of interdependence remains central to understanding system reliability.</p>
                <p>Incorporating <span style="font-weight: bold">redundancy</span> into interdependent networks can
                    mitigate the impact of cascading failures by providing alternative pathways or backup components,
                    thereby enhancing overall system resilience.</p>
                <p>In <span style="font-weight: bold">less complex systems</span>, interdependence can be analyzed by
                    examining how failures propagate through a <span style="font-weight: bold">process chain</span>,
                    affecting the final yield or performance. The following scenarios illustrate how interdependence
                    influences reliability and how recovery mechanisms can improve outcomes.</p>

                <p>As introduced earlier in this chapter, <span style="font-weight: bold">reliability</span> is a
                    measure of how consistently a system, product, or service performs its intended function without
                    failure over a specified time period. To quantify this consistency—or its absence—sveral key <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">reliability metrics</span> are used. These metrics help evaluate
                    performance, identify areas for improvement, and guide design and maintenance decisions.</p>

                    manufacturer may need to revise the design. If expectations are lower, the product has exceeded
                    performance standards. (Haney, 2021)</p>

                <p>As established in previous sections, all products, systems, and machinery are susceptible to failure
                    over time. To prevent or delay such failures, <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">maintenance</span> plays a critical role in ensuring continued
                    functionality and operational reliability.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Maintenance</span> encompasses all activities aimed at keeping
                    equipment and systems in working order. It includes both <span style="font-weight: bold">preventive
                        measures</span>, designed to avoid failures before they occur, and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">reactive measures</span>, which address issues after a failure has
                    taken place. The overarching goal is to sustain performance, extend asset life, and minimize
                    downtime.</p>
                <p>Effective maintenance management depends on a firm’s ability to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Establish and foster a maintenance culture</span></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Promoting awareness, accountability, and proactive behaviour across all levels of the
                        organization.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring that maintenance activities directly support the reliability targets of systems and
                        equipment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These foundational concepts will be explored in the following sections to provide a comprehensive
                    understanding of maintenance as a strategic function within operations management.</p>
                <p>These concepts will be briefly examined in the following sections.</p>
                <p class="docx_heading2">Maintenance Culture</p>
                <p>A strong <span style="font-weight: bold">maintenance culture</span> is foundational to achieving high
                    levels of equipment reliability and operational excellence. It extends beyond the maintenance
                    department, requiring commitment from <span style="font-weight: bold">every employee</span>, from
                    machine operators to senior management. In such a culture, maintenance is not viewed as a reactive
                    task but as a shared responsibility embedded in daily operations.</p>
                <p>This collective mindset fosters <span style="font-weight: bold">proactive </span><span
                        style="font-weight: bold">behaviour</span>, where potential issues are anticipated, communicated
                    early, and resolved collaboratively. Employees understand their roles in maintaining equipment
                    health, performing basic preventive tasks, and reporting abnormalities promptly.</p>
                <p>A well-established maintenance culture lays the groundwork for <span style="font-weight: bold">Total
                        Productive Maintenance (TPM)</span>, which integrates principles of <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">Total Quality Management (TQM)</span> with a strategic,
                    organization-wide approach to maintenance.</p>

                <p class="docx_heading3">Key Elements of a Maintenance Culture</p>
                <p>Employees can play essential roles in supporting maintenance management through the following
                    behaviors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Ownership of Equipment</span><br />Operators take responsibility
                        for routine inspections, cleaning, and identifying early signs of wear or malfunction. This
                        sense of ownership increases accountability and responsiveness.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Prompt Communication</span><br />Staff are encouraged to report
                        issues immediately, helping to minimize downtime and prevent minor issues from escalating into
                        major failures.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Collaboration Across Functions</span><br />Cross-functional
                        communication between production and maintenance teams ensures that operational insights are
                        shared, enabling more effective troubleshooting and planning.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Continuous Learning and Training</span><br />All employees
                        receive training in basic maintenance practices, safety protocols, and improvement techniques.
                        This reinforces a culture of vigilance and continuous improvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By breaking down silos between departments, a strong maintenance culture promotes a <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">holistic approach</span> to asset management, aligning maintenance
                    with broader organizational goals.</p>

                <p>As established throughout this chapter, <span style="font-weight: bold">maintenance is a key enabler
                        of reliability</span>. The effectiveness of maintenance activities depends on how well they
                    align with the principles of reliability engineering—namely, minimizing failure, maximizing uptime,
                    and optimizing asset performance over time.</p>
                <p>While various maintenance strategies offer different levels of success, two advanced approaches—<span
                        style="font-weight: bold">Reliability-Centred Maintenance (RCM)</span> and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">Risk-Based Maintenance (RBM)</span>—are particularly effective in
                    aligning maintenance with reliability goals.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">RCM</span> is a comprehensive strategy that integrates multiple

                        style="font-weight: bold">criticality, failure modes, and operational context</span>. It
                    uses <span style="font-weight: bold">Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)</span> to identify the
                    most appropriate maintenance method—reactive, preventive, or predictive—for each asset.</p>
                <p>RCM is especially valuable in industries with <span style="font-weight: bold">diverse and
                        mission-critical assets</span>, such as utilities, pharmaceuticals, and food processing, where

                <p class="docx_heading1">Cost of Reliability and Maintenance</p>
                <p>Improving reliability through maintenance inevitably incurs costs. According to fundamental economic
                    principles, these costs must be weighed against the <span style="font-weight: bold">benefits of
                        increased reliability</span>, such as reduced breakdowns, lower repair expenses, and improved
                    operational continuity.</p>
                <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold">cost dynamics</span> vary depending on the maintenance strategy
                    employed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Reactive maintenance</span> typically results in <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">low prevention costs</span> but <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">high repair costs</span>, as failures occur more frequently and
                        often unexpectedly.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Preventive maintenance</span>, on the other hand, involves <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">higher upfront prevention costs</span> but significantly <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">reduces repair costs</span> by minimizing the frequency and
                        severity of failures.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The goal is to find an <span style="font-weight: bold">optimal balance</span> between these two cost
                    components to minimize <span style="font-weight: bold">total maintenance cost</span> while achieving
                    desired reliability levels. As illustrated in the Figure, this balance is achieved through <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">intelligent maintenance</span>, where the <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">total cost is minimized</span> at the point where <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">repair and prevention costs intersect</span>.</p>

                <p class="docx_heading2">Key Considerations in Cost Balancing</p>
                <p>Two important points must be considered when evaluating maintenance cost strategies:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Variability in Cost Curves</span><br />Different preventive
                        measures yield varying levels of failure reduction at different costs. This results in <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">multiple prevention and repair cost curves</span>, each with its
                        own rate of change (ΔCost / ΔBreakdown). Consequently, the <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">balanced maintenance zone</span> may shift, producing <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">multiple total cost curves</span> and <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">different optimal points</span>. For simplicity, the curves shown
                        in Figure ??? represent <span style="font-weight: bold">average cost behaviour</span>.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Accounting vs. Opportunity Costs</span><br />Traditional cost
                        analysis often focuses on <span style="font-weight: bold">direct (accounting) costs</span>—such
                        as labor, parts, and downtime. However, <span style="font-weight: bold">opportunity
                            costs</span> must also be considered. These include:</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lost production and delivery delays</li>
                    <li>Customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of future sales</li>
                    <li>Reputational damage</li>
                    <li>Safety risks and reduced employee morale</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <p>As shown in Figure A, increasing preventive maintenance reduces breakdowns, but beyond a certain
                    point, the <span style="font-weight: bold">marginal benefit</span> of further prevention may not
                    justify the rising cost. However, when <span style="font-weight: bold">opportunity costs</span> are
                    included (Figure B), the optimal level of maintenance commitment shifts, potentially
                    justifying <span style="font-weight: bold">zero breakdown tolerance</span> in high-stakes
                    environments.</p>

                <p>To determine the appropriate level of maintenance investment, organizations should adopt a <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">full-cost approach</span>, incorporating both direct and opportunity
                    costs. This requires access to historical data on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Breakdown frequencies and probabilities</li>
                    <li>Repair durations and costs</li>
                    <li>Maintenance expenditures</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following example illustrates how this approach can guide decision-making between reactive and
                    preventive maintenance strategies.</p>

                <p class="docx_heading1">Chapter Summary</p>
                <p>This chapter provided a comprehensive exploration of <span style="font-weight: bold">reliability and
                        maintenance</span> within the context of operations management. It began by emphasizing the
                    critical role these concepts play in ensuring uninterrupted service delivery and minimizing life
                    cycle costs for both products and services.</p>
                <p>The chapter introduced <span style="font-weight: bold">reliability</span> as a probabilistic measure,
                    demonstrating how system performance is influenced by the configuration of components—whether
                    in <span style="font-weight: bold">series</span> or <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">parallel</span>—and how <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">redundancy</span> can significantly enhance overall system
                    reliability.</p>
                <p>A detailed review of <span style="font-weight: bold">maintenance strategies</span> followed,
                    including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Reactive (Corrective) Maintenance</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Preventive Maintenance</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Predictive Maintenance</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Condition-Based Maintenance</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Reliability-Centred Maintenance (RCM)</span></li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Risk-Based Maintenance (RBM)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each strategy was discussed in terms of its application context, advantages, limitations, and
                    suitability for different asset types and operational environments.</p>
                <p>The chapter also addressed the <span style="font-weight: bold">economic implications</span> of
                    maintenance decisions, highlighting the importance of balancing <span
                        style="font-weight: bold">repair costs</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">prevention
                        costs</span>. It introduced the concept of <span style="font-weight: bold">opportunity
                        costs</span>, such as lost productivity, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage,
                    which are often overlooked in traditional cost analyses.</p>
                <p>A real-world case study illustrated how historical data and cost modelling can guide the selection of
                    an optimal maintenance strategy using a <span style="font-weight: bold">full-cost approach</span>.
                    Comparative tables and decision frameworks throughout the chapter helped synthesize key insights and
                    support practical application.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Background</span><br />Holiday Baskets is a small seasonal business
                    specializing in the preparation and delivery of nut baskets during the Christmas season. The company
                    was founded by Helen Hemkey, who oversees all aspects of operations—from order intake to final
                    delivery.</p>
                <p>The business model is simple: customers place orders for baskets containing four types of nuts—<span
                        style="font-weight: bold">walnuts, cashews, almonds, and peanuts</span>—all of which are kept in
                    stock. Helen receives the orders, picks the required quantities of nuts, and places them into bags
                    along with shipping labels. These are then sent to the <span style="font-weight: bold">basketing
                        workshop</span>, where her four employees—<span style="font-weight: bold">Dianne, Nancy, Sue,
                        and Mariam</span>—assemble the final product.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Dianne</span> works independently at Table 1.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Nancy and Sue</span> collaborate at Table 2, with Nancy starting
                        the basket and Sue completing it.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Mariam</span> works independently at Table 3.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once assembled, the baskets are labelled and placed on the <span style="font-weight: bold">pick-up

                <p>Descriptive Questions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Define system reliability and explain how it changes in a series
                            versus parallel configuration.</span></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">System reliability</span> is the probability that a system will
                        perform its intended function without failure for a specified period under stated conditions. In
                        a series configuration, all components must work for the system to work; thus, system
                        reliability decreases as more components are added (Rs = R1 × R2 × ... × Rn). In a parallel
                        configuration, the system operates as long as at least one component works, so overall
                        reliability increases with redundancy because backup units reduce the probability of total
                        failure.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Discuss the role of redundancy in improving system reliability,
                            providing an example.</span></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Redundancy</span> adds backup components to mitigate failures.
                        For example, in a 2-unit parallel system (such as two pumps), even if one fails, the other can
                        keep the system operational. This significantly improves the overall system reliability, as
                        illustrated: Rs = R1 + (R2 × (1 - R1)). For R1 = R2 = 0.7, Rs = 0.91, which is much higher than
                        the reliability of a single component.</li>

                        failure occurs. Its main disadvantages are unpredictability, potential for expensive emergency
                        repairs, risk of unexpected downtime, secondary damage to equipment, and possible safety
                        hazards.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Preventive maintenance (PM)</span> is scheduled at regular
                        intervals regardless of actual equipment condition, intending to minimize breakdowns. <span
                            style="font-weight: bold">Predictive maintenance</span> uses real-time monitoring and data
                        analytics to anticipate failures and schedule maintenance precisely when needed. <span

                <ul>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Reliability-centred maintenance</span> focuses on maximizing
                        asset availability and operational safety by analyzing failure modes and their effects,
                        optimizing maintenance tasks accordingly. <span style="font-weight: bold">Risk-based
                            maintenance</span> prioritizes resources toward assets where the risk and potential
                        consequences of failure are greatest, aiming for overall risk reduction and safety assurance.
                        Both are data-driven, but risk-based is more focused on consequence rather than availability.
